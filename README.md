<h2><center>Master Thesis</center></h2>

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the usefulness of deep neural networks in
trading systems used when playing the stock market. Firstly introduced the issues related to
financial markets, followed by a description of the most important elements of artificial
neural networks. The theoretical part ended with a review of articles, where experiments
similar to the topic of the project were realised.
The main idea of the performed experiments was to compare the stock market trend
classification approach with next-day price prediction. For this purpose, historical data of
the EUR/USD currency pair was used, enhanced with technical indicators and relevant
labels. The implementation and learning of recurrent neural networks was then undertaken,
and the best model was used to create several investment strategies. The suggested solutions
were tested by means of simulated trading, in which the yearly rate of return was determined,
giving information on the value of the generated revenue. A final analysis of the results
allowed the selection of the most beneficial system in terms of profitability and investment
risk.
